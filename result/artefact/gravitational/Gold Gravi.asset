    text: 'A gravity regulator artifact of a split-off evolutionary branch of the Quirk family. Formed in a Blackhole alongside the Goldfish, but in a totally different way. This artifact creates a sustained field of negative gravity, which makes both the wearerâ€™s backpack and the wearer themselves much lighter. Due to its rarity, not all of its properties are well-studied.'
