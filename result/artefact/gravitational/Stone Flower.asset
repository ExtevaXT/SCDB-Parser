    text: 'Created in a Trampoline anomaly, This artifact can be found in several regions of the Zone. The inset metallic compounds create a beautiful play of light. The artifact creates a weak gravitational field that can affect flying low-speed projectiles. It has a significant effect on the psyche, so it is less valuable than other, similar artifacts.'
