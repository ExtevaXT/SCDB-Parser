    text: 'An extremely rare artifact. Like other “jellyfish,” it is formed in the Trampoline anomaly. For a long time, this artifact was thought not to exist at all. Its properties place it somewhere between a Dark Jellyfish and a Night Star, but it is not radioactive. While it has a positive effect on the mind, rumor has it that the side effects lead to a decrease in pain tolerance.'
