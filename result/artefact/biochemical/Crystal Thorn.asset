    text: 'An artifact that is made by the Burnt Fuzz anomaly. A small sphere made of matte crystal, covered in cracks and needle-like growths. When worn, it cleanses the body of radiation fairly quickly. During use, this artifact increases the risk of bleeding when injured, similarly to a regular Thorn.'
