    text: 'An artifact that is made by the Burnt Fuzz anomaly. A gray sphere covered in a thick layer of not particularly sharp spikes. Very lightweight. Wearing this artifact rids the body of all accumulated radiation and toxins almost instantly, but while in use, it increases the risk of spontaneous bleeding due to frequent fluctuations in blood pressure.'
