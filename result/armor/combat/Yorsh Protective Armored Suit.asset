    text: 'A multipurpose platform made from various types of components and modules. Assembled by tinkerers from the remains of broken armor sets. Surprisingly, this system came out very well, although itâ€™s not particularly reliable. The main engineering feature of this set is the external electrical impulse dissipation system. Made up of external bolt surge dischargers combined into a single system, it creates a kind of Faraday cage. The bolts sticking out on top also provide excellent protection from most local fauna and give this suit a unique and eye-catching appearance.'
