    text: 'This suit is a good choice for anyone who wants to sneak up behind the enemy unnoticed (even in the middle of the night—it comes with excellent NVG!) and set up a “grenade shower.” The enemy has little chance of survival... unless they’re also equipped with Grenadiers and manage to flee quickly.'
