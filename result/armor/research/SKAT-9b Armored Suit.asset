    text: 'An armored suit made from components analogous to those in the SKAT-9m suit. The expensive NVG has been replaced with a more widespread model. The resulting cost reduction made it possible to install oxygen tanks and an advanced air-filtration system. This means the armor is maximally adapted for working in areas of the Zone with high levels of radiation and biological infection.'
