    text: 'Getting an undamaged Zarya-A from a stalker is pretty difficult, so the kingpins decided to order a shipment of RS-33s, which are more resistant to the effects of anomalies, on the black market. A PMG gas mask and oxygen tanks are included in the suit. To compensate for the weight of the tanks, they decided to use lighter materials for the body armor.'
