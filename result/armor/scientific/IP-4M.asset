    text: 'This gas mask with an IP-4M closed breathing system is a really handy gizmo. The most comfortable way to wear it is with a hazmat suit. Someone decided to multiply the benefit of wearing this suit a tenfold by creating a lining made of light plates that improve protection against bullets and other forms of physical damage. What they ended up with was a good suit for a novice stalker who has grown out of wearing a jacket, but can’t yet afford a suit like the Zarya model.'
