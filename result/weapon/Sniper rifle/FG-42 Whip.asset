    text: 'As rumor has it, a shipment of German rifles from the Second World War was intercepted and ended up in the Zone in the hands of a group of foreign mercenaries. The rifles have been modified: the weapons have been updated for the more common 7.62 ammo, and the baseline rate of fire has been reduced for improved control. A key feature is now its capability for short bursts of fire at double firing rate, causing colossal damage over a set period of time.'
