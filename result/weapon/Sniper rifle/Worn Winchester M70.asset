    text: 'An American rifle with a longitudinally sliding bolt introduced in 1936. Its impressive effectiveness along with its low cost made it popular among many gunmen, and, as a result, it became widely distributed all over the world. The rail, which was added by a repairman, doesn’t look particularly aesthetic, but doesn’t interfere with the aiming line either, allowing it to be aimed with open sights.'
