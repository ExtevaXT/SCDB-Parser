    text: 'This assault rifle looks exactly the same as the SVT-40, with just a small alteration to the trigger mechanism. In terms of its weight and size, the AVT-40 is indistinguishable from the SVT-40. Due to some structural flaws, it wears out quickly, as continuous automatic fire can deform the receiver.'
