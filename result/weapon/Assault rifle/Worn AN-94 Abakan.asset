    text: 'A modern assault rifle developed to replace the then-aging AK-74. One of its main features is the ability to fire bursts of two shots with high accuracy (at a range of 100 meters, both bullets hit the same point). This substantially increases the chances of taking down a target thanks to the combined penetrative and stopping power of the bullets.'
