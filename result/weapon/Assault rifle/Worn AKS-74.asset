    text: 'A 5.45 mm caliber AK Kalashnikov assault rifle developed in 1970 using Mikhail Kalashnikov’s design, and first used by the armed forces of the USSR in 1974. This model is a further development of the AKM. It was developed as a result of the changeover to new, low-impulse 5.45x39 mm ammo.'
