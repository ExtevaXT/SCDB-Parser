    text: 'A representative of a new family of assault rifles. Thanks to its high reliability, accuracy, and ease of handling, it is one of the best examples of a weapon in its class. It is not frequently encountered in the Zone, and it costs a pretty penny. It is usually seasoned stalkers who order one of these specially for themselves.'
